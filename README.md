Assignment7
Perform Clustering(Hierarchical, Kmeans & DBSCAN) for the crime data and identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences.

Data Description:
Murder -- Muder rates in different places of United States
Assualt- Assualt rate in different places of United States
UrbanPop - urban population in different places of United States
Rape - Rape rate in different places of United States
1b)Perform clustering (hierarchical,K means clustering and DBSCAN) for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters. 
Draw the inferences from the clusters obtained.

Data Description:
 
The file EastWestAirlinescontains information on passengers who belong to an airlineâ€™s frequent flier program. For each passenger the data include information on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent miles in the last year. The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers

ID --Unique ID

Balance--Number of miles eligible for award travel

Qual_mile--Number of miles counted as qualifying for Topflight status

cc1_miles -- Number of miles earned with freq. flyer credit card in the past 12 months:
cc2_miles -- Number of miles earned with Rewards credit card in the past 12 months:
cc3_miles -- Number of miles earned with Small Business credit card in the past 12 months:

1 = under 5,000
2 = 5,000 - 10,000
3 = 10,001 - 25,000
4 = 25,001 - 50,000
5 = over 50,000

Bonus_miles--Number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months

Bonus_trans--Number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months

Flight_miles_12mo--Number of flight miles in the past 12 months

Flight_trans_12--Number of flight transactions in the past 12 months

Days_since_enrolled--Number of days since enrolled in flier program

Award--whether that person had award flight (free flight) or not

Assignment8
Perform Principal component analysis and perform clustering using first 
3 principal component scores (both heirarchial and k mean clustering(scree plot or elbow curve) and obtain 
optimum number of clusters and check whether we have obtained same number of clusters with the original data 
(class column we have ignored at the begining who shows it has 3 clusters)df

Assignment9
Prepare rules for the all the data sets 
1) Try different values of support and confidence. Observe the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values
2) Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm
3) Visulize the obtained rules using different plots
